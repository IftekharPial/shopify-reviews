# Shopify Review Scraping Implementation Notes

## Current Implementation

The current scraper uses **mock data generation** for demonstration purposes. This is because:

1. **JavaScript-Heavy Pages**: Modern Shopify app review pages load content dynamically via JavaScript
2. **Anti-Bot Protection**: Shopify has sophisticated anti-bot measures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive scraping can lead to IP blocking

## Mock Data Features

- Generates 5-15 realistic reviews per app
- Random store names, countries, and ratings
- Reviews dated within the last 25 days
- App-specific content customization
- Prevents duplicates using existing database logic

## For Production Implementation

To implement real scraping, you would need:

### Option 1: Headless Browser (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Puppeteer or Selenium
npm install puppeteer
# or
pip install selenium
```

### Option 2: API Integration
- Check if Shopify provides official APIs for review data
- Partner with review aggregation services

### Option 3: Enhanced HTTP Client
- Use rotating proxies
- Implement CAPTCHA solving
- Add sophisticated header rotation
- Handle JavaScript rendering

## Current Mock Data Structure

```php
$reviews[] = [
    'store_name' => 'Example Store',
    'country_name' => 'United States', 
    'rating' => 5,
    'review_content' => 'Great app!',
    'review_date' => '2025-01-15'
];
```

## Testing the Scraper

```bash
# Test via API
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"app_name":"StoreSEO"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/scrape-app.php

# Test via command line
cd backend
php scraper/shopify_scraper.php https://apps.shopify.com/storeseo
```

## Legal Considerations

- Always respect robots.txt
- Implement reasonable delays between requests
- Consider terms of service compliance
- Use official APIs when available
